/* IdentityStore manages exactly one thing: the current user's keypair and pseudonym. There's no list, no ID-based
 * lookup, no getAll(). The interface is essentially a typed credential store — save(...) once at registration, then
 * read individual fields. Calling it IdentityRepository would imply a collection of identities could exist, which
 * doesn't match the model (one device = one identity).
